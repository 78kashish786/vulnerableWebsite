# Vulnerable React App

A purposefully vulnerable application built with React (frontend) and Java Spring (backend). It is meant to be used for testing and learning about security vulnerabilities.

It is built using [reactvulna](https://github.com/vulnerable-apps/reactvulna) and [javulna](https://github.com/vulnerable-apps/javulna) by [edusecmachine](https://github.com/edu-secmachine/) with some light modifications to make them work.
